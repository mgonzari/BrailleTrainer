This project presents a low-cost, open-source Braille learning device for children with visual impairments. It offers tactile and auditory feedback to support early literacy. We are currently seeking institutions and educators to collaborate in the validation and testing phase.

Welcome to the Braille Learning Device Project
This initiative aims to support the early literacy of children with visual impairments through an interactive, low-cost, and open-source device. The prototype provides tactile and auditory feedback to help users identify Braille letters independently.

We are currently looking for educational institutions and professionals who work with blind children to collaborate in the validation phase.

Here you’ll find:
– A short demo video of the device
– Project documentation and objectives
– Consent forms for participation
– Contact information to join or support the project

Let’s build inclusive tools together.
